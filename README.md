# pinephone-max30102
Pulse Oximeter and
Heart-Rate sensor board for PinePhone

Sensor board attaches I2C interface exposed on the pogo pin expansion port in the back of the PinePhone.  
Interface is numbered as i2c-3 in multiple operating systems.
To expose the power and interfaces in the pogo pins you can use my other design "PinePhone flex breakout board".
